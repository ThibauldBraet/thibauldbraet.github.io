To find the perfect place to live in NYC, it is necessary to consider different metrics. According to us Crime, Education and Housing prices are the most important ones. However, one person can give different importance to these metrics in comparison with his peers. A investment banker without family, money, time or even a life could just be looking for a place to sleep while a family of four attaches a lot of importance to their living conditions. That's why we made a tool to find the best place to live, tailored to your needs.

In the map below you can give an importance to each section by moving the sliders with the slider at dragged to the left meaning a high importance. The map will be updated accordingly but since this might not always be as clear, we provided you a table as well with the top 10 ranking of the ZIP Codes scoring best on your preferences.
