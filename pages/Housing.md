When looking for housing, people want to buy as cheap as possible, a large area to live on and if it is possible with a view on Central Park. Achieving all of these is of course not possible. This webpage gives an overview of the most important metrics to consider when looking for a house in NYC and how each region of NYC scores on this metric. When looking for a house, people care most about the quality price ratio, measured in the area to live in and the price you have to pay for the property. The neighbourhood to live in is important as well but this is measured by other metrics like education and crime rates, described in the other webpages
