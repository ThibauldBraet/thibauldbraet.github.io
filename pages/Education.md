When looking at the quality of a school, an undeniably universal standard is 
the graduation and dropout rates of a school. With this in mind, we examine
these rates among the schools of NYC. In doing so, we make it possible to find
particular problem areas as well as areas in which it would be particularly easy
to raise a child with a good education.

ToDo: Discuss test scores

### Trends by Borough
To begin our analysis of education, we'll examine NYC at the level of its
boroughs. Our two primary metrics for this purpose will be the graduation and
dropout rates in percent. It's important to note that, as some students take
more or fewer years in school, the two metrics
rarelyy add up to 100% and serve as independently useful standards of education 
quality.

Below, we see two graphs tracking the graduation and dropout rates between boroughs:

![Dropout  % per Year](../img/education/dropout_%_borough.png)

Interestingly, there is a definite trend towards improvement in all boroughs.
Efforts to improve education in NYC have had a serious effect on student
success. 

Beyond this, it's interesting to note how relative success within boroughs has
gone almost entirely unchanged over ten years.  
The Bronx has had a consistently lower graduation rate and a higher dropout
rate. Meanwhile, Staten Island has consistently performed better than the other
boroughs. This suggests that, while pushing to improve education has a tangible benefit, it doesn't solve the underlying problems that often cause students to fail out of schools: poverty and other extenuating circumstances that can shape lives.
