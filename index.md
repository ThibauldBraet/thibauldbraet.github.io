New York City is a city of 8.5 million inhabitants, a number which is still growing.

A lot of people are moving to New York to live since it is the epicentre of the world and THE city people imagine when they think about the American dream.

Finding a place in New York is however a difficult task. One wants to live in a nice neighbourhood in a comfortable house.
For families moving to NYC it might also be important to find a place where they could stay there whole life instead of just finding a room to purely sleep.

To evaluate the living conditions in NYC, we looked at three categories:
* [Crime rate](pages/Crime): nobody wants to get stabbed on his way to the grocerie store.
* [Education](/pages/Education) : Families want there kids to have a nice future which all start with a proper educatio
* [Housing](/pages/Housing): you still should be able to afford to buy a place in NYC and preferable with a good quality price ratio

Besides looking at all these categories seperatly, we will also have a look if these metrics are [correlated](/pages/Overall). Do high crime rates correspond with a lower graduation rate. Are neighbourhoods more prone to crime also cheaper to live in?

New York City has been ahead of his time since very long and has collecting data to support all these analysises. When other cities start collecting data in the same way, it might be useful to do scale this project up in other cities.
