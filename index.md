New York City is a city of 8.5 million inhabitants and is constantly growing.

New York is often considered to be the epicentre of the world and THE city that people imagine when they imagine the American dream. As a result many people have moved to New York and continue to do so every year.

Finding a place in New York is, however, a difficult task. Often, one wants to live in a comfortable house with a nice neighbourhood. Furthermore, for families moving to NYC, it's also important to find a place where they can live long term and safely raise a family.

To evaluate the living conditions in NYC, we looked at three categories:
* [Crime rate](pages/Crime): Safety is priotiy #1. 
  * Nobody wants to get stabbed on his way to the grocerie store.
* [Education](/pages/Education) : Success is rooted in education. 
  * It's important to any family that their children get a good education.
* [Housing](/pages/Housing): New York ain't cheap. 
  * When it comes down to money, you still need to be able to find an affordable place to live.

In addition to looking at these metrics independently, we also examine them in [combination](/pages/Overall). How does each part of New York stack up when we examine these three key metrics? 

Fortunately, NYC has collected massive amounts of data on every one of these aspects. As we move further into the information age and more cities begin collecting data in the same way, it would be useful to scale-up projects like this one and adapt them to new locations.
